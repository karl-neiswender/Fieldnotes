# Current status (2026-11-03)

- Repository created. No add-on code yet, by design.
- Decisions: name **Fieldnotes**; Classic Era + Forever; heat map (Approach A) with a
  plot-point toggle (Approach C); Show: Me / My Account / Community; stats panel;
  low-friction sharing by copy-paste string, like Forever Goal Tracker's feedback link.
- GitHub: https://github.com/karl-neiswender/Fieldnotes (public), `main` pushed.
- Mockups in `design/mockups-2026-11-03` approved by Karl on 2026-11-03.
- v0.1.0 built (Core, Recorder, Stats): skin detection, account-wide records, `/fn`.
  `python3 tools/check.py` passes; copied to Era and Forever. Not yet tested in game.
- Demo mode (`/fn demo`, `/fn fake`, `/fn demo off`) works in game (Karl, Era, 2026-11-03).
- v0.3.0: Map.lua, the world map overlay, reviewed in game on Era (demo Dun Morogh):
  slim top bar (Heat/Points, Me/Account/Community, leather list), soft heat
  (Media/blob.tga), hover hot spot pins, corner key. Checks pass.
- Not yet tested: real skinning (Karl's characters are too low); Forever client.
- Style.lua: Forever Goal Tracker's look (etch, gold chosen state, title gold, pill switch,
  icons); map restyled with it, reviewed in game 2026-11-03.
- v0.4.0: Session.lua (session tracker), Panel.lua (stats window, /fn), map settings behind
  the gear (leather, 5 color schemes, Heat by, When, Strength, Spread, Thin areas), Spotlight
  view, continent/world zone badges (reviewed in game on Era 2026-11-03). Checks pass (21).
- Not yet seen in game: the stats window and session tracker; real skinning; Forever client.
- Known: on Kalimdor the Moonglade badge sits under the map bar.
- Ideas queued (Atlassian heatmap guide): comparison view (diverging Me vs Community),
  "when you skin" day x hour grid in stats, counts beside hot spot pins, stepped legend.
- Next: Karl reviews the stats window in game; then sharing (share strings, import).
